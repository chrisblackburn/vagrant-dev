Common commands
===============
Some common things you might like to do:


Symlink your vhost file
-----------------------
Load your configuration in to Apache:

 `sudo ln -s /var/www/<your-project>/config/httpd.conf /etc/apache2/sites-available/<your-project>.conf`


Restart Apache
--------------
Force Apache to pick up the configuration changes:

 `sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart`


Run JSLint
----------
You're recommended to run this before pushing any code changes upstream. Jenkins will run this task as part of the build step.

 `java -jar /usr/lib/jslint4java/jslint4java-2.0.2.jar <path-to-your-js-directory>/*.js`


Run CSSLint
-----------
As with JSLint - run before pushing code changes upstream.

 `csslint <path-to-your-css-directory>/*.css`
